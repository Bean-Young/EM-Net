# GroudTruth for PAD
We provide a set of segmentation masks derived from the PAD-UFES-20 dataset, which includes 30 dermatological images captured via cellphone, each exhibiting unique characteristics. These images, segmented under the supervision of dermatologists. 
Where each image is its name corresponding to the GroundTruth encoded in the PAD dataset, the labels have been processed into a binary mask form that can be used directly.
